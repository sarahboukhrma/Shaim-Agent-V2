## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS:

### **Step 1: Describe Your Problem**
```
Home Page → Enter your name → Describe problem
```

**Example:**
"Two workers got into a physical fight in the warehouse on June 15th. One worker suffered minor injuries. This is the first violent incident in 3 years."

### **Step 2: Click "🤖 Analyze with AI"**
AI starts thinking...

### **Step 3: AI Analysis Appears**

**You'll see:**

#### **📋 AI Problem Analysis**
AI's understanding of your problem

#### **🎯 3 Potential Root Causes**
AI suggests possible organizational causes:
- Example: "Inadequate conflict resolution procedures"
- Example: "Lack of employee well-being prioritization"
- Example: "Insufficient supervisor training in de-escalation"

#### **🔍 AI-Generated Five Whys**
AI creates complete analysis automatically:
- **Why 1:** "Why did the fight happen?" → "Because verbal conflict escalated to physical violence"
- **Why 2:** "Why did it escalate?" → "Because no intervention occurred during the argument"
- **Why 3:** "Why no intervention?" → "Because supervisors lacked clear escalation procedures"
- **Why 4:** "Why no procedures?" → "Because company doesn't have formal conflict resolution policy"
- **Why 5 (ROOT CAUSE):** "Because organizational culture prioritizes productivity over employee well-being and safety infrastructure"

#### **💡 Key Insights**
- "This is a systemic issue, not individual failure"
- "Pattern indicates organizational policy gap"
- "Root cause is cultural/strategic"

#### **📊 Evidence to Gather**
- "Review company conflict resolution policy documentation"
- "Check supervisor training records"
- "Audit incident reporting procedures"

### **Step 4: Generate Recommendations**

Click "📝 Generate Recommendations"

**AI creates:**

#### **⚡ Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)**
- Specific action steps
- Who's responsible
- How to measure
- Timeline

**Example:**
```
Action: Implement emergency conflict de-escalation protocol
Timeline: 24 hours
Responsible: Safety Manager
Measurable: Protocol document created and distributed to all supervisors
```

#### **📅 Short-Term Solutions (1-3 months)**
- Detailed countermeasures
- Resources needed
- Expected outcomes

**Example:**
```
Solution: Develop and implement comprehensive conflict resolution training
Timeline: 6 weeks
Resources: External trainer, 40 hours staff time
Expected Outcome: 100% supervisor completion, 80%+ assessment scores
```

#### **🎯 Long-Term Solutions (3-12 months)**
- Strategic organizational changes
- Investment required
- Long-term impact

**Example:**
```
Solution: Organization-wide culture transformation program
Timeline: 12 months
Investment: $50,000 budget allocation
Impact: Shift to employee-centric safety culture, reduce incidents by 80%
```

#### **📊 Monitoring Plan**
- What metrics to track
- Target values
- How often to measure
- Who's responsible

```
You: "Workers fought in warehouse"
AI: "Tell me more details. When did this happen?"
You: "June 15"
AI: "Why did they fight?"
You: "They were angry"
AI: "Why were they angry?"
[You do all the thinking]
```

### **After (v4.0) - AI Intelligence:**
```
You: "Workers fought in warehouse on June 15"
AI: 🧠 Analyzing...

AI generates:
✅ 3 potential root causes
✅ Complete Five Whys

## 💡 REAL EXAMPLE:

### **Your Problem:**
"Production line stopped for 4 hours on Feb 10. Machine breakdown. Lost $50,000 in production. This is the 3rd breakdown this month."

### **AI Generates:**

**Potential Root Causes:**
1. Inadequate preventive maintenance program
2. Deferred equipment investment
3. Production pressure overriding maintenance schedules

**Five Whys:**
- Why 1: Machine components failed due to wear
- Why 2: Worn components weren't replaced during maintenance  
- Why 3: Maintenance schedule doesn't include proactive parts replacement
- Why 4: Maintenance budget focused on reactive fixes only
- Why 5: **ROOT CAUSE:** Company culture prioritizes short-term cost savings over long-term equipment reliability

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate: Inspect all similar machines (48 hours)
- Short-term: Implement predictive maintenance program (2 months)
- Long-term: Shift to total productive maintenance philosophy (12 months)

**Monitoring:**
- Track: Mean time between failures (MTBF)
- Target: Increase MTBF by 200%
- Frequency: Monthly
- Responsible: Maintenance Manager
